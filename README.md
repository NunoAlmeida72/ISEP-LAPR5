# RobDroneGo - ISEP-LAPR5

**Project developed in an academic environment**

## üìò Description

A prototype system is to be developed for task execution management involving a fleet of robots and drones. The system will be called **RobDroneGo**.

The system should consist of the following modules:

- **Device Management**
- **Task Request Management**
- **Task Execution Planning**

Since this is a prototype system, not all modules will be fully developed, and it is acceptable for only some functionalities to be implemented.

In addition, the following infrastructure features were implemented:

- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines were developed for building, testing, and deploying the system components.
- **Database Backups:** Scripts were created on a Linux server to perform **daily backups** of the system‚Äôs databases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Master Data Devices & User Management:** Node.js  
- **Master Data Tasks:** .NET  
- **User Interface (UI):** Angular & Three.js  
- **Task Planning:** Prolog  
- **Database:** MongoDB
